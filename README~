Step 1: Record data
Run live_record.m to store files
Step 2: Copy files from inside the timestamped folder

Step 3: annotate_images
Step 4: verify_annotations

Step 5: compute_transform - does least squares computation to determine Tf between camera frame and robot frame
Step 6: verify_transform - Projects the 3D point back into RL camera frames using Tf computed above
